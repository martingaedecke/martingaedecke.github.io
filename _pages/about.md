PhD Student in Sociology at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

About me
======
Hello everyone,

I'm Martin, a Sociology PhD Student at the University of Oxford. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's and Masters in Social Sciences at Humboldt University, Berlin. This esteemed institution equipped me with valuable skills in quantitative research techniques, particularly in sequence analysis and life course research—skills that continue to shape my work.

Originally hailing from Brandenburg, the outer area of Berlin, my heart remains tied to the city despite my transition to Oxford. Beyond academia, I find joy in traveling, playing football, and indulging my passion for photography. While I consider myself an enthusiastic photographer (albeit a beginner), you can catch glimpses of my work on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/m.a.gaedecke/).

Thanks for stopping by!

My research
======
I am currently immersed in the study of the determinants and consequences of unplanned parenthood within the broader context of the life course. Despite being a prevalent phenomenon, unintended pregnancies constituted a significant 51% of all pregnancies in the US in 2008, as highlighted by Finer and Zolna in their 2014 study [](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24354819/).

Individuals facing unplanned parenthood encounter simultaneous challenges, including the search for childcare, adjustments to housing situations, and the negotiation and adaptation of work-family reconciliation. Surprisingly, the field of unplanned parenthood, specifically referring to unintended pregnancies carried to term, remains largely overlooked in research.

My dissertation is organized into three chapters, aiming to unravel the intricate challenges confronted by parents experiencing unplanned parenthood. To achieve this, I employ longitudinal methods, utilizing sequence analysis to delve into the consequences for employment and family life following unplanned parenthood. Through this research, I seek to contribute valuable insights to this often-neglected area of study.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

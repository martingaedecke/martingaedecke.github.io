PhD Student in Sociology at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

About me
======
Hello everyone,

I'm Martin, a Sociology PhD Student at the University of Oxford. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's and Masters in Social Sciences at Humboldt University, Berlin. This esteemed institution equipped me with valuable skills in quantitative research techniques, particularly in sequence analysis and life course research—skills that continue to shape my work.

Originally hailing from Brandenburg, the outer area of Berlin, my heart remains tied to the city despite my transition to Oxford. Beyond academia, I find joy in traveling, playing football, and indulging my passion for photography. While I consider myself an enthusiastic photographer (albeit a beginner), you can catch glimpses of my work on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/m.a.gaedecke/).

Thanks for stopping by!

My research
======
Currently, my research is centered on the study of fertility intentions and realization within the context of Australia. Fertility intentions, as reliable predictors of future fertility rates, have garnered significant attention, particularly in affluent democracies where individuals often desire more children than they ultimately have. This phenomenon has sparked discussions on parenthood postponement and low fertility rates. Yet, there remains a gap in understanding how childbearing plans evolve over the life course and how employment influences the realization of fertility intentions.

Drawing on my expertise in the study of fertility intentions and realization, I am particularly focused on examining the interplay between employment, specifically job prestige, and fertility intentions and realization among individuals aged 23-40 in Australia. My research aims to address crucial questions regarding the evolution of childbearing plans over the life course and the influence of employment on the realization of fertility intentions.

Employing longitudinal methods and utilizing sequence analysis techniques, I analyze data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA) spanning 2001 to 2022 (N=3,066). Through this research, I seek to offer a nuanced understanding of the relationship between employment, fertility intentions, and realization, with a particular emphasis on gender differences in Australia's socio-economic context.

Preliminary findings suggest that while fertility intentions may not be strongly associated with high-prestige job trajectories, there is a notably higher likelihood of realizing those intentions, especially among men. Recognizing the significance of gender and employment in the fertility-intention-realization gap is crucial for informing policies that support individuals in achieving their childbearing plans.
